      <h4>Creating the dish</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          First, make your turkey ragu. Add the coconut oil to a pan on a medium
          to high heat. Add the onion and sauté for 3-4 minutes, then add the
          garlic and sauté for a further 2 minutes (if you're using the powdered
          versions, add them after the next step).
        </li>
        <li>
          Next, add the turkey mince and break it up a little using a spatula,
          then allow it to brown for 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in
          the oregano, ½ tsp. salt and pepper and the tomatoes and simmer on a
          low heat for 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          While you're waiting, whisk cottage cheese and egg whites together in
          a bowl using a fork with the remaining salt and pepper. Set aside.
          Preheat the oven at 200°C or 180°C for fan-assisted.
        </li>
        <li>
          Now prepare your courgette and lasagne sheets. Use a vegetable peeler
          to slice the courgette lengthways to get long slices. Wash the lasagne
          sheets under cold water in a colander.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the turkey ragu is ready, it's time to make up the lasagne. Start
          with a layer of courgette sheets for easy removal once cooked. Then
          alternate between the ragu, cheese sauce, lasagne sheets, and
          courgette. Finish with a layer of lasagne, then cheese sauce, then
          sprinkle with low-fat cheese.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake for 15 minutes with foil on, then remove the foil, turn the heat
          up by 20°C and bake for a further 20 minutes. Once cooked, divide into
          four meal prep containers, serve with your favourite salad or
          vegetables and store in the fridge for up to three days.
