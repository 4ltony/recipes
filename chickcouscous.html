      routine of normal waking hours and a diet that doesn't consist entirely of
      cheese.
    </h3>
    <p>
      This spicy chicken recipe is bursting with flavour and is a simple way to
      liven up plain old chicken and rice meal prep. It's ideal for making up on

        <h4>Creating the dish</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Firstly, make a marinade for your chicken by adding the curry paste, chutney, turmeric, salt and olive oil to a bowl and mixing well.</li>
            <li>Then, cut each chicken breast in half and add to the marinade, stirring until well covered, and then leave aside for at least 20 minutes — ideally in the fridge overnight.</li>
            <li>Next, heat a grill pan over medium heat and lay out your chicken pieces. Grill for 5-6 minutes on each side, or until golden and slightly charred.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, place the couscous in a big bowl and carefully pour in the boiling vegetable stock. Cover the bowl with a lid and leave to soak for around 5 minutes, then fluff your couscous with a fork and add any extras you want — pomegranate seeds are great for a flash of colour and burst of flavour.</li>
            <li>Finally, divide your couscous into 4 containers, top with two pieces of marinated chicken and finish with a sprinkle of coriander.</li>
